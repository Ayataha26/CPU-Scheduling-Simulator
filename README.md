This is a graphical Python application that simulates CPU scheduling using the Round Robin algorithm. Designed as a final project for an Operating Systems course, the tool allows users to input processes with their Arrival Times and Burst Times, specify a Quantum, and visualize how CPU scheduling behaves.

🚀 Features

📥 User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
⏱ Implements Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm
📊 Visualizes CPU execution timeline with Gantt Chart (via matplotlib)
✅ Input validation with descriptive error messages
📈 Displays detailed stats:
Waiting Time
Turnaround Time
Finish Time
Response Time
🖥 Interface Preview

💡 Enter number of processes, their Arrival and Burst times, then hit “Calculate” to generate the schedule and chart.
🧩 How to Run
